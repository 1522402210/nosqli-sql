    Use:   "scan",
    Short: "Scan endpoint for NoSQL Injection vectors",
    Long: `Scan an endpoint for NoSQL Injection vectors. This will return text 
specifying whether an injection was successfully found or not.

Examples:
    nosqli scan -u http://localhost/page?id=5`,
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        fmt.Printf("Running scan on %s...\n\n", target)

/* Tests:
 - Check for error text in the response. Sample: 
 Fatal error: Uncaught MongoDB\Driver\Exception\CommandException: unknown operator: $ in /var/www/html/user_lookup.php:37 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/html/user_lookup.php(37): MongoDB\Driver\Manager->executeQuery('sans.users', Object(MongoDB\Driver\Query)) #1 {main} thrown in /var/www/html/user_lookup.php on line 37

 This is when GET param in PHP is given something like param[$invalid_operator]=text - since this passes an invalid operator in and mongo throws up.

 You can also have something like this:
 Exception: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal : functionExpressionParser@src/mongo/scripting/mozjs/mongohelpers.js:48:25
In file: /var/www/html/guess_the_key.php
On line: 48

when passing in a single or double quote as an argument. http://localhost:8080/guess_the_key.php?guess=%27%22%7B%7D#

In this one, it's direct JS injection, not really mongo injection per se.
